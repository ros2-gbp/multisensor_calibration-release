### ExtrinsicCameraLidarCalibration(Nodelet)

Nodelet to perform extrinsic camera-LiDAR calibration without any ui or guidance.

**How to use as standalone:**

1. After starting up, the calibration nodelet continuously detects the ArUco marker inside the camera image and selects possible region of interests inside the LiDAR cloud. It publishes the
marker detections as well as the regions of interest in the topic '~/<camera_sensor_name\>/annotated_image' and '~/<lidar_sensor_name\>/regions_of_interest', respectively.
2. Visualize the data published in the previous step for example in rviz and make sure that the calibration target is seen both in the camera image as well as the LiDAR scan.
3. To trigger the detection of the calibration target and to capture its pose, call the provided service of the calibration nodelet: '~/capture_target'.
4. Depending on the data, the detection of the target can take up to a couple of seconds.
5. When the target has successfully been detected in both the camera image as well as the LiDAR data, an instant calibration is performed with just this target pose. A corresponding message is printed in the command line with the mean reprojection error of this calibration. If not successful a corresponding message is also printed. Typical reasons for a detection not being successful is either that the target is not detected in the LiDAR scan or that the reprojection error exceeds a certain threshold (Default: 2px). If latter is the case the threshold can be increased by calling 'rqt_dynamic_reconfigure'.
6. Since the detection of the calibration target from the camera image is very reliable, only the detection inside the LiDAR cloud is published for visual inspection, i.e. inside the topics
'~/<lidar_sensor_name\>/target_pattern' and '~/<lidar_sensor_name\>/marker_corners'.
7. If the detected pose is not satisfactory one can remove the last detection by calling the appropriate service: '~/remove_last_observation'.
8. For a good calibration 5 to 7 different poses of the calibration target should be used, ideally moving it around the three coordinate axes. For each pose, repeat steps 2-7.
9. When enough different calibration poses are collected, the calibration can be finalized by calling the service: '~/finalize_calibration'. This will do a final calibration, print out the resulting extrinsic parameters as well as the overall mean reprojection error and the confidence of the calibration. The calibration results and a urdf snippet, together with the observations (if requested) are written into the calibration workspace.
NOTE: For a good final calibration a typical mean reprojection error is between 2-4 pixels.

### ExtrinsicLidarLidarCalibration(Nodelet)

Nodelet to perform extrinsic LiDAR-LiDAR calibration without any ui or guidance.

**How to use as standalone:**


1. After starting up, the calibration nodelet continuously selects possible region of interests inside both LiDAR clouds. It publishes the marker detections as well as the regions of interest in the topics '~/<[src|ref]_lidar_sensor_name>/regions_of_interest'.
2. Visualize the data published in the previous step for example in rviz and make sure that the calibration target is seen both in the camera image as well as the LiDAR scan.
3. To trigger the detection of the calibration target and to capture its pose, call the provided service of the calibration nodelet: '~/capture_target'.
4. Depending on the data, the detection of the target can take up to a couple of seconds.
5. When the target has successfully been detected in both LiDAR data, an instant calibration is performed with just this target pose. A corresponding message is printed in the command line with the mean reprojection error of this calibration. If not successful a corresponding message is also printed. Typical reasons for a detection not being successful is that the target is not detected in the LiDAR scan.
6. The detection inside the LiDAR cloud is published for visual inspection, i.e. inside the topics '~/<[src|ref]_lidar_sensor_name>/target_pattern' and '~/<[src|ref]_lidar_sensor_name>/marker_corners'.
7. If the detected pose is not satisfactory one can remove the last detection by calling the appropriate service: '~/remove_last_observation'.
8. For a good calibration 3 to 5 different poses of the calibration target should be used, ideally moving it around the three coordinate axes. For each pose, repeat steps 2-7.
9. When enough different calibration poses are collected, the calibration can be finalized by calling the service: '~/finalize_calibration'. This will do a final calibration, print out the resulting extrinsic parameters as well as the overall root mean squared error and the confidence of the calibration. The calibration results and a urdf snippet, together with the observations (if requested) are written into the calibration workspace.

### ExtrinsicCameraReferenceCalibration(Nodelet)

Nodelet to perform extrinsic camera-reference calibration without any ui or guidance.

**How to use as standalone:**

1. After starting up, the calibration nodelet continuously detects the ArUco marker inside the camera image. It publishes the marker detections in the topic '~/<camera_sensor_name\>/annotated_image', respectively.
2. Visualize the data published in the previous step for example in rviz and make sure that the calibration target is seen both in the camera image as well as the LiDAR scan.
3. To trigger the detection of the calibration target and to capture its pose in the camera image, call the provided service of the calibration nodelet: '~/capture_target'.
4. Depending on the data, the detection of the target can take up to a couple of seconds.
5. When the target has successfully been detected a corresponding message is printed in the command line. If not successful a corresponding message is also printed.
6. If the detected pose is not satisfactory one can remove the last detection by calling the appropriate service: '~/remove_last_observation'.
7. Measure the top-left corner of each ArUco marker, for example, with a Total Station.
8. Pass all measured coordinates of the top-left marker corners to the calibration by calling 'ros2 service call /<node_name\>/<reference_name/>/add_marker_observations iosb_calibration_interface/srv/AddMarkerObservations "{ observation: { marker_ids: [1, 2, 3, 4], marker_top_left_point: [{x: 1.0, y: 2.0, z: 3.0}, {x: 1.0, y: 2.0, z: 3.0}, {x: 1.0, y: 2.0, z: 3.0}, {x: 1.0, y: 2.0, z: 3.0}]} }'.
9. For a good calibration 5 to 7 different poses of the calibration target should be used, ideally moving it around the three coordinate axes. For each pose, repeat steps 2-8.

The calibration results and a urdf snippet, together with the observations (if requested) are written into the calibration workspace. For a good final calibration a typical mean reprojection error is between 2-4 pixels.

**NOTE:** Step 8 (entering of the reference coordinates) does not necessarily need to be done directly after each measuring of the coordinates. It is can also be done iteratively for all observations before Step 10. However, it is important that the measurements are added in the correct order.

### ExtrinsicLidarVehicleCalibration(Nodelet)

Nodelet to perform extrinsic LiDAR-LiDAR calibration without any ui.
The idea in this calibration is that for which have LiDAR sensors that also "see" part of the robots body, on can estimate the position of the LiDAR sensor by aligning the LiDAR scans to a model of the robots body.
This is done by manually selecting corresponding regions in both sensor cloud and model. To do so, use the point picking tool of rviz to pick a point in the corresponding clouds round which a planar region is to be estimated. The selected regions are then aligned using a GICP. For region selection a plane is fitted into the cloud at a selected marker point using RANSAC. Prior to GICP the clouds are filtered using Statistical Outlier Removal. The transformation guess for the GICP is computed by using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to estimate a rigid transformation from the seed points around the selected region markers.
**NOTE:** This work, however, is a prototype implementation and needs further development.

### PointCloud2PointCloudDistance(Nodelet)

Nodelet to calculate the n-to-n distance for a list of point clouds.
For each point cloud in the list, the smallest distance with respect to all other point clouds is found.
The calculated distance is normalized with respect to a given maximum distance and stored in the intensity field of the source point cloud.
This can then be used to colorize the distance in a point cloud viewer, such as rviz.

To calculate the distance between the point clouds, this nodelet uses two distance measures, which can be selected by the appropriate launch parameter:

- `point_2_point`: This calculates the euclidean distance between each point in the source point cloud and the nearest neighbor in the target point cloud (transformed into the frame of the source point cloud). 
In this, it finds the *n* nearest neighbors (ordered by their distance) and takes the distance to the first one in the list.
- `point_2_surface`: In order to calculate the distance of a point to a surface, information on the surface normal needs be available. 
Thus, in this case, the nodelet first computes the normal vectors for the transformed target point cloud. 
It then, again, finds the *n* nearest neighbors in the target point cloud to each point in the source cloud. 
The distance is then calculated by first computing the plane parameterization for each neighbor and its corresponding normal vector.
This followed by calculating the orthogonal distances of the source point w.r.t. each parameterized surface.  
The smallest of these orthogonal distances is then selected as the point-2-surface distance.

Prior to calculating the distance between two point clouds, the target point cloud is transformed into the coordinate system of the source point cloud.
In this way, since the source cloud is to be enhanced with distance information, the source cloud does not need to be transformed back prior to publishing.
The transformation is found, by first extracting the frame IDs from header of each point cloud, which can then be used to look it up in the TF tree.

**Launch-Parameters:**

- ```number_of_clouds```: Number of clouds to process. The input topics are appended with a index as suffix: `cloud_0`, `cloud_1`, ..., `cloud_N-1`.<br>
    *Type: int*<br>
    *Default: 2*
- ```processing_rate```: Rate in (Hz) at which to process the received point cloud.<br>
    *Type: int*<br>
    *Default: 1*
- ```distance_measure```: Enum: {0 = **point_2_point**, 1 = **point_2_surface**}<br>
    *Type: Enum: {0 = point_2_point, 1 = point_2_surface}*<br>
    *Default: 0*<br>
    *NOTE: The point_2_surface measure is more robust with a higher number of nearest neighbors. Especially when using point clouds from a rotating LiDAR, as a parameterization of a small number of neighbors might lead to a selection of all neighbors on one ring, making the surface estimation less accurate.*
- ```num_nearest_neighbors```: Number of nearest neighbors to consider in the target cloud for each point in the source cloud.<br>
    *Type: int*<br>
    *Default: 5*
- ```max_distance```: Maximum distance at which to truncate. This is also used for normalization when calculating the intensity.<br>
    *Type: float*<br>
    *Default: 5.0*
- ```clamp_distance_threshold```: Distance at which to clamp the source point cloud. Points exceeding the distance are removed. It is truncated to a minimum of 'max_distance'.<br>
    *Type: float*<br>
    *Default: FLT_MAX*
- `temp_transform`: *(Only available if 'number_of_clouds = 2')* Temporary transform of camera with respect to LiDAR given in the form of XYZ and RPY. The values are to be given as string list separated by whitespace. If left empty or omitted the transformation will be extracted from the TF-tree by using the frame IDs of the images and the clouds.<br>
