*With a graphical user interface the Multi-Sensor Calibration Toolbox guides the user through the calibration of a camera-LiDAR sensor setup.*

## About

`multisensor_calibration` is an actively maintained universal calibration toolbox for assisted, target-based multi-sensor calibration with ROS 1 and ROS 2 support. 
It provides a variety of methods and applications to calibrate complex multi-sensor systems, e.g.

- <b>Extrinsic Camera-LiDAR Calibration</b>,
- <b>Extrinsic Camera-Reference Calibration</b>,
- <b>Extrinsic LiDAR-LiDAR Calibration</b>,
- <b>Extrinsic LiDAR-Reference Calibration</b>, and
- <b>Extrinsic LiDAR-Vehicle Calibration</b> (prototype).

The latest source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/FraunhoferIOSB/multisensor_calibration).
Furthermore, the `multisensor_calibration` will also be released as an official package for ROS 2 and be installable with apt.
Since ROS 1 is soon end-of-life, there will be no official release for ROS 1.
However, there is a version of the source code available for ROS 1 under the branch [noetic](https://github.com/FraunhoferIOSB/multisensor_calibration/tree/noetic).

## Getting Started

1. See our [Installation](installation.md) page on how to install it with apt-get as ROS 2 package or how to build from source.
2. Look at the [Tutorial](tutorial.md) page on how to use use it to calibrate your sensor setup.

## Support
